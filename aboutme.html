      Some of the many functions that scratch has are very similar. As well as that python is not too hard to use
      just like scratch.The only difference now is that we have to actually write out the coding and learn about
      data types. And commands that we didn't have to write out before. Python is also extremely sensitive, one wrong
      symbol or a capitalization then the whole program would not work. Debugging our program was hard because it would
      be mstakes that we would pass over because of how small they were. It was a bit frustrating but once we were able
      to make it work it was well worth the wait. It was easier since the prompt would tell us where the problem lied in
      so we wouldn't have to go over the whole code.

      A list is a collection of number. They are useful because they can hold numbers and you can use them for specific
      tasks. I think the group that was able to work together effiecently and help each other was the best group. It does
      not matter if you're the smartest one because you would still need help. What I liked the most was that we were able
      to create our own image.

      This is an image of the circuit that we created today that is able to power on an LED on the click of a button.
      It was extremely helpful to work on this with other girls because it was challenging. My idea on a robot has changed
      because I used the word in a general way when it i more obejective. I am nervous that robots one day will make
      everything obsolete.

      This is an image of the circuit that we created today that is able to sense its surroundings and based on an algoritum
      that we coded it would move in order to avoid hitting an object. It was extremely helpful to work on this with other
      girls because it was challenging. We used infared to use as our sensor while others used whisler wire.

      One thing I learned about the internet is how costimizable you can make it. You can create your own webiste.
      You can make it interactive and it's incredibly fun to do. It can get a bit complicated though and slightly messy,
      but with time and practice you can make something more efficent.
