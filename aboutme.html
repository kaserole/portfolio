      Some of the many functions that scratch has are very similar. As well as that python is not too hard to use just like scratch.
      The only difference now is that we have to actually write out the coding and learn about data types. And commands that we didn't
      have to write out before. Python is also extremely sensitive, one wrong symbol or a capitalization then the whole program would not work.
